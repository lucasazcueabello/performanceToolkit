# performanceToolkit

This version of the toolkit incorporates a new functionality that can measure multiple versions of the same same code in different programming languages and creates a bar graph that compares the results. 

This version includes the binary-trees implementation in languages of C, Python, Java, C++, PHP, and JS, from The Computer Language Benchmark Game.

The configurations.yaml has been modified to include the execution and compilation command for these especific files.
